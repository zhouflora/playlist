# My Personal Project

# *Music Organizer*

### What will the application do?
This application is my venture to create a simple organizational tool that allows users to store and retrieve 
information about their favourite songs. See below for specific features I've implemented!

### Who will use it?
Users who want a place to keep track of their music may enjoy this application!

### Why is this project of interest to me?
I'm a *big fan* of music -- I love discovering new songs, creating playlists, and looking at the patterns in my music 
taste. I wanted to create an application for people with a similar passion who would enjoy the features of my app.

## User Stories
As a user, I will be able to:
* add songs to different playlists of my choosing
* remove songs from any playlist I've added it to
* see a high-level overview of my playlists, particularly the 
name of my playlist, and the titles of all the songs I've added to it
* retreive the full details of a song when viewing my playlists
